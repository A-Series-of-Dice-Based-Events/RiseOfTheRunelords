If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition (page 620) with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse."},{"id":"_8ykxk4fcd6g","name":"Magical Trickster","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"offense","description":"Whether you’re using magic items, wielding innate magic, or dabbling in spellcasting, you can sneak spells past your foes’ defenses as easily as any blade. When you succeed at a spell attack roll against a flat-footed foe’s AC and the spell deals damage, you can add your sneak attack damage to the damage roll. If your single spell leads to multiple separate damage rolls, apply your sneak attack damage only once per target."}],"alignment":"n","size":"medium","type":"humanoid","adjust":0,"description":"**Before Combat** Gogmurt uses speak with animals and casts produce flame.

Gogmurt calls Tangletooth to his side and directs her in\ncombat using speak with animals.\n**During Combat** Gogmurt casts entangle on the first round\nof combat, taking care to place the spell so that it blocks\naccess to area C9 but doesn’t block his own possible\nescape routes. On following rounds, he\nfights with his spells, throwing fire\nfrom produce flame make\nranged attacks. As soon as he’s brought below 25 hit\npoints, he retreats by fleeing into the brambles, heals\nhimself as best he can, and then returns to ambush the\nPCs from behind by casting summon animal.\n<br>**Morale** If he is ever brought below 15 hit points and has\nno healing left, Gogmurt attempts to flee north to warn\nWarchief Ripnugget about the PCs.
