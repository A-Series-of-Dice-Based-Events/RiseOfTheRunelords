# RotR Burnt Offerings lv1-4

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder second edition (2E)

  - This conversion guide only covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and monsters, hazards, DCs, XP, treasure, and occassionally tactics where they don't convert well from 1E.
  - The plot, backstory, color text, floor plans, maps, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
  - Creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON files are in a consolidated sub directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In some instances there are several variants available.
  - The associated monster builder PDF and PNG files are also in this sub directory and referenced by this document (their unique numerical suffixes assigned by monster builder are removed to save updating this document every time the creature is tweaked)

### General TO DO

  - DCs
  - Hazards
  - PF2 Treasure by level allocation - replace old treasure with new level guidelines

## Friendly NPC Roster (key stats only)

  - [Sherriff Belor Hemlock](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=936) - If required use the Watch Officer from the GMG.
  - 12x [Town Guard](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=933) - of which 3-4 are typically on duty at any one time with one on patrol. If required use the Guard from the GMG.
  - 60x Militia - combat trained weekly and can be activated at a few hours notice. If required use the Guard from the GMG. 
  - [Father Abstalar Zantus - cleric of Desna] - Cleric 4 
  - 4x [Cathedral Acolytes](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=893) using the Acolyte from the GMG.
  - [Ameiko Kaijutsu - tavern owner] Bard 4
  - [Ilsoari Gandethus - Headmaster] Wizard 4
  - [Daviren Hosk - stable owner] Ranger 4
  - [Shelelu Andosana - Elven Ranger] Ranger 5
  - [Brodert Quink - Sage] - Has the skill Thassilon Lore. Speaks Thassilonian and several other languages. 
  - townsfolk using the downtrodden, laborers, tradespeople, performers, publicans, foresters or other appropriate low level [NPCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx) from the GMG

  - Note there is a lot of background detail in the Sandpoint campaign setting that is useful, though with first edition stats. Be careful if using color text from it as it is set after the events of this adventure path and contains many subtle spoilers.
  
## Part 1: Festival and Fire (320xp, Party Level 1)

  - Part 1 shouldn't be brutal but rather fun and exciting. 
  - As the players run through Part 1, have Father Zantus or an acolyte come to their aid with healing if any of the PCs get too beat up. This is especially important before encounter 3 (Die Dog. Die!) which is a severe threat encounter. This is also a good intro to Father Zantus (cleric 4) who is protecting the Cathedral and directing his acolytes to help injured townsfolk.
  - Apply the [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) template to creatures in later encounters if you need to reduce the difficulty for inexperienced or unlucky players.
  - Also possible is peripheral combat help from the town guard, militia and other key NPCs they may have met at the festival - such as tavern owner Ameiko Kaijutsu, schoolmaster Ilsoari Gandethus, stable owner Daviren Hosk - or just an arrow or crossbow bolt fired from a window or doorway by local militia. However, avoid taking agency away from the PCs.

### Goblin notes

  - During the festival raid the goblins use the opportunity to loot as much as possible and many will stuff their pockets or loot sacks with whatever they can lay their hands on: e.g. meat, fruit, (not vegetables!), bread, tankards, cups, cutlery, cooking utensils, pans, children's toys, wood carvings, souvenirs, jewellry, hats, chickens, butterflies, other tiny animals, babies...

### B12. Shrine to Lamashtu

  - Waters of Lamashtu, Fortititude Save DC 22 
    - Drinking the Waters of Lamashtu temporarily twists your mind and body. Repeated doses over many weeks can cause permanent changes that are rarely beneficial.
    - Critical Success: No effect
    - Success: Sickened 1 as your body purges the waters from your system
    - Failure: Clumsy 1 and Stupefied 1 for 1 minute
    - Critical Failure: Clumsy 1 and Stupefied 1 for 1 day
    - Any failure gives visions of your worst mental character flaw or personal failure amplified and twisted to a horrific degree - and it feels like your body is being twisted into a dark mockery of your best physical features.
  - **Loot:**
    - 4 doses of unholy water (not included in level based treasure as highly unlikely to have any utility, though may have some creative uses)

    - +1 weapon potency rune (P2)
    - returning rune (P3)
    - low grade cold iron dagger

## Part 4A. Thistletop Approach (565xp, assumed party level 2)

  - A full frontal assault would be a serious mistake for the party. The encounters here require bypassing, splitting or neutralizing and at all costs to avoid them running together.
  - Shalelu should have forwarned them and, for inexperienced players, consider having her accompany them to provide tactical advice and/or combat support - though in a background way that does not take away from the party achievements.
  - The terrain for all encounters here increases the threat level by one step - and adds bonus XP appropriately (as if the creatures encountered were 1 level higher).

    - Lyrie is a firm believer in the adage that wizards belong nowhere near the front line of combat.

  - **Tactics**
    - Before combat: If forewarned: Nualia uses the Sihedron Medallion to cast False Life, then casts Protection (either Good of Lawful, depending on what she knows about the party), and finally Spiritual Weapon, though she is unlikely to be able to sustain it for long.
    - During Combat: Nualia uses her heightened Fear spell and Intimidating Glance to demoralize her enemies. Then follows up with sweeping Falchion attacks and harm. She uses her Shield spell if she has an action free.
    - Morale : if reduced to 21 or less HP, she tries to escape. She casts Sanctuary, Athletic Rush or Animal Form (for speed) as approprite to make good her escape.
