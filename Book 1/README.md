# RotR Burnt Offerings (Level 1-4)

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder second edition (2E)

  - This conversion guide only covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and creatures, hazards, XP, treasure, and some tactics where they don't convert well from 1E.
  - The plot, backstory, color text, floor plans, maps, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
  - Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/).
  - Unique and missing 2E creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in the statblocks directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In some instances there are several variants available.
  - If you find an issue, error or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then post on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H) or create a pull request. This is a community project and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## General GM information

  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
  - DCs are not converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. All other DCs are left to GM discretion. See [level based DCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554) for guidance.
  - Note there is a lot of background detail in the Sandpoint campaign setting that is useful, though with first edition stats. Be careful if using color text from it as it is set after the events of this adventure path and contains many subtle spoilers.

## Party Levelling Milestones

- Level 1: up to the Catacombs of Wrath 
- Level 2: start Catacombs of Wrath (Pt3.5)
- Level 3: start Thistletop Island (Part 4)
- Level 4: conclusion of Thistletop (Part 4)
- Level 5: party should be close to (or just at) level 5 at the end of the book (within 200 XP). 

Using Fast Track Advancement, as per the original AP, the target for this book is therefore 3,000+ level adjusted XP. There is around 10% more than this available in the book, to allow for optional encounters.

[Full Level to Wealth Chart](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=581)

[Treasure allocation approach](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18jlGuaCs5O1qm3dP0zck3_I4YpZK4_aEerwI_J5LOnk/)

This adventure contains all treasure for 1st through 4th levels.

The wealth to level chart was followed such that the treasure explicitly laid out in the "loot" sections adds up to exactly 1,835 GP in value (175 gp + 300 gp + 500 gp + 860 gp). Permanent items and consumables matching the guidelines were provided (i.e. 2x 1st level and 2x 2nd level permanent items for Level 1).

As a general rule divide the gp values of valuables by 10 to convert to 2E. Occasionally they are divided by 20 in order to fit the 2E wealth guidelines. 

All magical items in 1E treasure are replaced by 2E items in this guide.

It's assumed that even though NPCs may use consumable items in their possession, those items will still become part of the loot. If you decide not to do this, you should replace it with something else (or just increase the cash value of currency items).

Spellbooks are valued at 50% of the cost of "learn a spell" for the highest-level spells only, usually those currently memorized by the NPC.

Sihedron Medallions are valued at 160 gp (equivalent to a 2nd level wand of False Life).

Treasure was provided for a party of 4. If you have additional party members, include additional treasure and items per the "Full level to Wealth Chart" and accompanying information linked above.

There is no spare treasure. If your players miss something early on in the adventure, you should include additional items later.

## Friendly NPC Roster  

If you need any stats for NPCs then the GMG has a [good selection of NPCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?Letter=All): 

  - [Sherriff Belor Hemlock (Watch Officer)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=936).
  - 12x [Town Guard (Guard)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=933). 3-4 are typically on duty at any one time with one on patrol.
  - 60x [Militia (Guard)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=933) - combat trained weekly and can be activated at a few hours notice.  
  - [Father Abstalar Zantus (Weak Priest)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=896).
  - 4x [Cathedral Acolytes (Acolyte)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=893).
  - [Cyrdak Drokkus (Elite Troubador)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=941)
  - [Ameiko Kaijitsu (Elite Troubador)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=941) - replace Theater Lore with Alcohol Lore and Sandpoint Lore.
  - [Ilsoari Gandethus (Elite Mage for Hire)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=922)
  - [Daviren Hosk (normal/elite Tracker)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=906) - replace Forest Lore with Horse Lore.
  - Shalelu Andosana as required from Level 2/3/4 [weak/normal/elite Tracker](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=906) in book 1 to Level 6/7/8 [weak/normal/elite Hunter](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=907) in book 3
  - [Brodert Quink (Sage)](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=950) - Add the skill Thassilon Lore. Add Thassilonian to his languages. 
  - townsfolk using the downtrodden, laborers, tradespeople, performers, publicans, foresters or other appropriate low level [NPCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx) from the GMG

 
## Part 1: Festival and Fire (350xp, Party Level 1)

  - Part 1 shouldn't be brutal but rather fun and exciting. 
  - As the players run through Part 1, have Father Zantus or an acolyte come to their aid with healing if any of the PCs get too beat up. This is especially important before encounter 3 (Die Dog. Die!) which is a severe threat encounter. This is also a good intro to Father Zantus (cleric 4) who is protecting the Cathedral and directing his acolytes to help injured townsfolk.
  - Apply the [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) template to creatures in later encounters if you need to reduce the difficulty for inexperienced or unlucky players.
  - Also possible is peripheral combat help from the town guard, militia and other key NPCs they may have met at the festival - such as tavern owner Ameiko Kaijitsu, schoolmaster Ilsoari Gandethus, stable owner Daviren Hosk - or just an arrow or crossbow bolt fired from a window or doorway by local militia. However, avoid taking agency away from the PCs. An unexpected arrow that misses can be an effective distraction and show the chaos that is the goblin attack. 

### Goblin notes

  - During the festival raid the goblins are not at all tactical and are there to cause chaos, set fire to things and loot as much as possible. Many will stuff their pockets or loot sacks with whatever they can lay their hands on: e.g. meat, fruit, (not vegetables!), bread, tankards, cups, cutlery, cooking utensils, pans, children's toys, wood carvings, souvenirs, jewelry, hats, chickens, butterflies, babies... 
  - Play the goblins as easily distracted by these activites.

### Initial Assault (60xp, low threat)

    - 3x [Goblin Warriors](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=232)

    - 2x[Goblin Pyro](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=234) - these have [Lesser Alchemists Fire](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=75) to set fire to wooden buildings. See loot below.
    - [Goblin War Chanter](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=235)
    - During Combat The warchanter casts bless and then uses her goblin song once each round until all PCs have been targeted. She rallies the goblins to focus on any PC who seems to be particularly dangerous. If she is wounded she casts soothe on herself.
  - **Loot:** 3 vials of [Lesser Alchemists Fire](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=75) (C1) that the goblins are using to burn wooden houses.

    - [Goblin Dog](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=236)

    - During Combat The goblin commando uses the superior mobility of his mount by using the Command An Animal action each round to remain out of melee so he can shoot at the PCs with his bow from dogback. If all of his goblin warriors are defeated, he drops his bow and races in to fight the PCs in melee.
    - 3x [Goblin Warriors](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=232)

    - Aldern has a painting commissioned entitled "The Heroes of Sandpoint" showing him and the PCs in action against the goblins, which makes it look like he is part of the party. He donates it to the Rusty Dragon to be hung in the lounge. (Note this is useful if you have party member changes between now and book 2 as it provides continuity)

    - Any goblins that fled part 1 join Tsuto here

### Eliminating the Catacombs threat (30xp story award and hero point)

  - for eliminating the threat the catacombs pose to Sandpoint, award 30xp

## Part 4A. Thistletop Approach (500xp, assumed party level 2)

  - A full frontal assault would be a serious mistake for the party. The encounters here require bypassing, splitting or neutralizing and at all costs to avoid them running together.
  - Shalelu should have forewarned them and consider having her accompany them to provide tactical advice and/or combat support - though in a background way that does not take away from the party achievements. Use an appropriate level Shalelu, possibly GMG Weak/Normal/Elite [Tracker](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=906) 
  - The terrain for all encounters here increases the threat level by one step - and adds bonus XP appropriately (as if the creatures encountered were 1 level higher).

### C4. Refugees Nest (120xp, severe threat, plus 40xp for terrain)

  - **Creatures:**
    - 8x [Goblin Warriors](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=232)

### C5. Kennel (120xp, severe threat, plus 40xp for terrain)

  - **Creatures:**
    - 4x [Goblin Dog](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=236) 
  - this encounter can be bypassed. If successfully bypassed award the same xp.

### C6/7. Tangletooth's Den and Gogmurt's Lair (80xp, moderate threat, plus 40xp for terrain)
  - Note that Gogmurt might be a good choice to start a goblin PC if that is wanted in your campaign. 
  - **Creatures:**
    - [Gogmurt PDF](./Statblocks/Gogmurt.pdf)
    - ![Gogmurt PNG](./Statblocks/Gogmurt.png)
    - [Tangletooth PDF](./Statblocks/Tangletooth.pdf)
    - ![Tangletooth PNG](./Statblocks/Tangletooth.png)

  - **Tactics:** Replace the before combat and during combat tactics as follows:
    - Before Combat: Gogmurt's leshy familiar Rooty is scouting above the briars, though spends more time enjoying flying on the breeze than scouting. If forewarned by Rooty or by combat elsewhere, Gogmurt uses his terrain stalker ability to watch the PCs to gauge their capabilities in combat and to judge whether to use his shield. When ready Gogmurt casts Shillelagh on his mace. He sends Rooty to the island to deliver a bloodstained goblin tooth to Warchief Ripnugget — a prearranged code to warn that the adventurers have finally arrived to murder them all. Gogmurt calls Tangletooth to his side and directs her in combat using command an animal.
    - During Combat: Gogmurt casts entangle on the first round of combat, taking care to place the spell so that it blocks access to area C9 but doesn’t block his own possible escape routes (though his feats allow him to move through it if needs must). He follows up with burning hands from the staff if he can do so safely and if he can avoid burning the bushes with it. On following rounds, he fights with his Shillelagh in one hand, using electric arc from the other when he needs to make ranged attacks. As soon as he’s brought below half hit points, he retreats by fleeing into the brambles using feather step, heals himself as best he can, and then returns to ambush the PCs from behind.
    - If the opportunity arises Gogmurt uses hydraulic push to push someone into the bunyip hole or off a cliff edge or the bridge.
    - Gogmurt uses his feather step ability to make maximum use of the bushes for cover and for sneaking. Note this feat also allows him to step into an entangle spell.
    
 - **Loot:** 
    - [Staff of Fire](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=356) (P3)

### C27. Bunyip Lair (60xp, low threat, plus 20xp terrain)

  - **Creatures:**
    - [Bunyip](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=62)
  - **Loot:** 
    - As this is an optional encounter no loot has been placed here. If they do defeat the Bunyip, this would be a good place to put some treasure that was missed earlier. 

## Part 4B. Thistletop island top (540xp, assumed party level 3)

  - At some point during Thistletop the party will have enough XP to reach level 4. All the encounters assume the party is level 3. So if they do level up before completing Thistletop then consider adjusting the encounters by adding extra minions or using the elite template.

### C9. Rope Bridge (5xp Hazard)

  **Hazard:**  
    - [Rigged Rope Bridge](./Statblocks/RiggedRopeBridge.pdf) 
    - ![Rigged Rope Bridge PNG](./Statblocks/RiggedRopeBridge.png)

    - Symbol of Sarenrae worth 4gp.

    - ![Lyrie Akenja PNG](./Statblocks/LyrieAkenja.png)

  - **Tactics** 
    - Lyrie has chosen Skivver's familiar abilities of darkvision and scent to give her warning of any approach
    - Replace the "During Combat" tactics with the following:
      - Lyrie is a firm believer in the adage that wizards belong nowhere near the front line of combat. If she expects to be engaged in close range combat or to be targeted then she casts mirror image. When she is forced into combat, she prefers her long range offensive abilities, such as Magic Missile, Hand of the Apprentice and Reach Spell solutions.

### E4. Observation Deck (120xp, severe threat)

    - [Yeth Hound](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=870)
    - [Nualia PDF](./Statblocks/NualiaTobyn.pdf) 
    - ![Nualia PNG](./Statblocks/NualiaTobyn.png) 

  - **Tactics**
    - Before combat: Nualia uses the Sihedron Medallion to cast False Life every day. If forewarned: she casts Protection (either Good of Lawful, depending on what she knows about the party), and finally Spiritual Weapon, though she is unlikely to be able to sustain it for long.
    - During Combat: Nualia uses her heightened Fear spell and Intimidating Glance to demoralize her enemies. Then follows up with sweeping Falchion attacks and harm. She uses her Shield spell if she has an action free.
    - Morale : if reduced to 21 or less HP, she tries to escape. She casts Sanctuary, Athletic Rush or Animal Form (for speed) as appropriate to make good her escape.
    - If the PCs retreat from Thistletop and Nualia thinks they have a few days grace she will birth a monster to add to the defenses using her [Mark of Lamashtu / Major Boon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=11). Likely another Yeth hound. She might also do this if captured and left alone.
