These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the Sihedron medallion wearer’s senses, and could speak through her voice—provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn.\nWhile worn, a Sihedron medallion grants the wearer a +1 item bonus to saving throws.\nPlaced on the neck of a dead body, a Sihedron medallion preserves the body indefinitely as a 2nd level gentle repose spell as long as the medallion is on the body.\nActivate (f) command; Frequency once per day; Effect the amulet casts a 2nd level false life on the wearer. \n\n \n\n"
