A still living victim can attempt a DC 17 Reflex save to avoid falling into the pit by either clinging to the portcullises or the statue alcoves, but when the pit closes automatically 1 round later, the victimâ€™s weight on the lid could start the cycle all over again.","plain":0,"meta":{"public":1,"url":"llQMfrvX"}}
