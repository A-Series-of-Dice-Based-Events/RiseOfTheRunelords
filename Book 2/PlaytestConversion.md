Make a roll for his Deception {-1} against the Will DC’s of all PC’s, anyone whose DC is greater than Ibor’s Roll notices he is hiding something when he speaks. Once made Friendly any PC can then use the make a Request action DC 15 Diplomacy to have him divulge the information about Harker skimming from the books. Ibor is innocent, award the PC’s 30xp for a successful interrogation.
 
Ven Vinder
      	This interrogation is insignificant, except if the PC’s managed to make an enemy out of Ven, in the first chapter. When he sees they have come to talk to him about the murder he immediately turns on them, cursing them and blaming them for the murder. If this happens, by the next set of murders have all the townsfolk drop one attitude towards the PC’s as Ven spreads lies and rumors.
 
The Sihedron Rune
      	If the PC’s seek out information about the Sihedron rune have them be directed to Brodert Quinck, the local Thassilonian expert. There the PC’s can learn about the Rune’s history and more importantly its link to the Sins/schools of magic. Award 30xp if they seek Brodert out on their own, or 10xp if he has to come find them.
The First Murders
      	Investigation of the mutilated bodies with a DC 15 Medicine or Religion check reveals the Five clawed human hand size marks of a Ghast. If the PC’s want to go interrogate Grayst Sevilla, Sherrif Hemlock gives them a letter of introduction to Habe, the man in charge of the sanitarium where Grayst is being kept.
 
The Sanitorium
      	Meeting the Doctor: Requires a Make an Impression action or Intimidate DC 18 to make him Friendly. If the PC’s present the letter from Sheriff Hemlock they get a +2 bonus to this check. Unless made friendly he refuses anyone entry even with the Letter.
      	Meeting Grayst: When meeting Grayst anyone who looks at Grayst and makes a DC 15 Medicine or Religion check can see that Grayst is sick and on the verge of Death, a critical success identifies his sickness as Ghoul Fever. A DC 19 Diplomacy check is enough to get Grayst talking, most of his sentences are jumbled and confusing, however if he notices the object of Aldern Foxgloves obsession he speaks one of the Messages from the Skinsaw Murders Chapter. A DC 14 Society or Geography Lore check reveals that the name “The Misgivings” is the name of the Foxglove manor south of Sandpoint. After his Message Grayst attacks, use Weak Ghast stats. Once Grayst is Subdued again Habe will not let the PC’s leave without their silence. If the PC’s Refuse the Orderlies attack while Habe gets Caizarlus’ help.
