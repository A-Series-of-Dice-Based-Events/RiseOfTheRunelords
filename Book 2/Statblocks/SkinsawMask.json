When worn, the mask fills the wearer’s mind with hideous whispers and images of murder and violence. It heightens the wearer’s ability to sense fear. He can smell the cold sweat brought on by terror and hear the thundering beating of a frightened heart. Further, fresh blood glows brightly to him, to the extent that he can see the shimmering traceries of living circulatory systems pumping away in the bodies of those around him. \n-\nWearing the mask grants a +1 bonus on Perception checks involving creatures with the frightened condition and attacks deals +1d4 evil damage with slashing weapons to frightened creatures. While the skinsaw mask is donned, it leaves hideous mental scars and the wearer is stupefied 1 as his thoughts become tangled with images of murder."
