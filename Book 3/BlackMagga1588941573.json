This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them."}],"morespells":[{"id":"_1u04oqnfad6","name":"","note":"","spellattack":{"value":"+25","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"+33","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":""}],"alignment":"ce","size":"gargantuan","type":"aberration","adjust":0,"description":"This enormous creature’s serpentine neck supports a leering reptilian head—its body is a wriggling mass of tentacles.\n\nInitial encounter:\nAs she has only just awoken from several hundred years sleep Black Magga is not yet at the height of her powers. Apply the double weak template.\n\nBlack Magga is having her worse day in millenia. She has just been rudely woken up from several hundred years sleep, by ogres banging on the dam, and which if left unchecked could destroy her home. While attempting to sort that out part of the dam collapsed under her and she fell over 200 feet to the valley below taking serious damage. Now she has spotted a church to a forbidden deity. This is the perfect outlet for her annoyance.\n\nTactics: Black Magga focusses on destroying the church and ignores anyone and anything else unless they attack or block her. If anyone stands up to her and lives through an attack, or she takes 10 or more points of damage from any source, or suffers a negative spell effect, this is enough to snap her out of her anger, and she retreats to the depths of Claybottom Lake to plan and recharge.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"+25","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":33,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"15ft, swim 40ft","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","demand","","dimensional anchor, divination, dominate person, greater command","","","","","Death Knell, Prayer; 1/day: commune, dream, unhallow"],"constant":"Invisibility Purge","strength":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":0,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"high","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"+8","benchmark":"high","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+29","benchmark":"high","note":"darkvision 60 ft"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":36,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"279","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"+29","benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"+26","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"+26","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"Acid 15, Cold 15, Physical 10 (except magic)","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"10 Cold Iron","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"death effects, mental, unconscious","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_68c4scnthl4","name":"Tentacle","traits":"magic (ethereal reach)","attack":"+28","damage":"3d10+14 bludgeoning plus grab","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_diheqvo5x7k","name":"Bite","traits":"","attack":"+32","damage":"3d12+26 plus drain 2","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Thassilonian"}
