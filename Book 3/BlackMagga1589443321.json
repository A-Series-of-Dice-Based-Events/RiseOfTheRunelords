This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them."},{"id":"_1j6zfnavxto","name":"Taste of Oblivion","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"general","description":"When a Black Magga damages with its jaws, the target receives a temporary vision of Lamashtu and their impending death.

Apply the weak or double weak template to keep her effective level within 5 of the party.\n\nBlack Magga is having her worse day in millenia. She has just been rudely woken up from several hundred years hibernation, by ogres banging on the dam, and which if left unchecked could destroy her home. While attempting to sort that out part of the dam collapsed under her and she fell over 200 feet to the valley below taking serious damage. Now she has spotted a church to an opposed deity. This is the perfect outlet for her annoyance.\n\nTactics: Black Magga focusses on destroying the church and ignores anyone and anything else unless they attack or block her. If anyone stands up to her and lives through a round of attacks, or she takes 10 or more points of damage from any source, or she suffers a negative status effect, this is enough to snap her out of her anger, and she retreats to the depths of Claybottom Lake to plan her revenge and recharge.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":25,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":33,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"Mother of Oblivion","speed":"15ft, swim 40ft","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":"","cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","Subconscious Suggestion","Dominate","Command (up to 10 creatures)","Dimensional Anchor, Read Omens, Anathematic Reprisal (at will; anathema: attempt to treat a mental illness or deformity, provide succor to Lamashtu’s enemies)","Dream Message (1/day)","Death Knell (at will)","Scholarly Recollection (at will)",""],"constant":"See Invisibility","strength":{"value":9,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":0,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"constitution":{"value":9,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":8,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":29,"benchmark":"high","note":"darkvision 60 ft, transdimensional tentacles, see invisibility"},"acrobatics":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":30,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":30,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"Ancient History only"},"stealth":{"value":21,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"survival":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"high","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":36,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":271,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":29,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"Acid 15, Cold 15, Physical 15 (except magic)","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"10 Cold Iron","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"death effects, mental","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Favored servant of Lamashtu","strikes":[{"id":"_diheqvo5x7k","name":"Jaws","traits":"","attack":32,"damage":"3d12+17 plus Taste of Oblivion","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_68c4scnthl4","name":"Tentacle","traits":"Transdimensional Tentacles","attack":28,"damage":"3d10+14 bludgeoning plus grab","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Thassilonian","tags":[]}
