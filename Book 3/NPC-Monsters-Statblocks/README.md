# NPC and Monster Statblocks

Using http://monster.pf2.tools/ you can import/export and share JSON files for your custom made creatures. 
Please share those JSON files here along with the PNG and PDF file downloaded from the monster builder tool.

The PDF and PNG files should be linked in the Book 3 README.md file, for example (remove the space between the square and round brackets to use)
  - [Black Magga PDF] (https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Book%203/black_magga.pdf)
  - ![Black Magga PNG] (https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Book%203/black_magga.png)

Please remove the number from the end of the filenames downlaoded from monster builder so that updates to the monsters do not require an update to the Book 3 README file.

Where multiple options for a single monster exists add them all into this file and explain the differences below.

## Rukus Graul - options example
  - **Explanation**
    - The party should be level 7 when they encounter the Rukus Graul.  
    - The party may have more than 4 members and likely have Shelalu as a combat NPC with them.
    - In the original RotR, Rukus was CR7 (a good challenge for a level 7 party of four).
    - This is a standalone scene setting encounter, and there is zero risk of this encounter running into another one.
    - Side note: The dogs are level 1 and 6 levels below the party and as such count as distractions only, though they do have some bearing on the encounter difficulty.
  - **Options**
    - Rukus Graul level 8 ogrekin (xp60, a low or moderate threat boss) - use for small or roleplay optimised parties
    - Rukus Graul level 9 ogrekin (xp80, a moderate or severe threat boss) - use for large or combat optimised parties
