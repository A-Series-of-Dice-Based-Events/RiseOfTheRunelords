# RotR Hook Mountain Massacre (level 7-10)

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder Second Edition (2E)

- This conversion guide covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and monsters, hazards, XP, level based treasure, and occasionally tactics.
- The plot, back story, color text, maps, floor plans, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
- Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/)].
- Unique or missing 2E creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in a sub directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In many instances there are several variants available. Note their unique numerical suffixes assigned by monster builder are removed to save updating this document every time the creature is updated.
- If you find an issue, error or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then create a pull request. This is a community project and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## TO DO
  - Possibly update NPC stats to reflect updated equipment? (Hucker, Crowfood, Mammy, Lamatar, Lucrecia, Barl)

## General GM information
  - DCs are not converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. This is left up to GM discretion.
  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
  - For Shalelu Andosana it is suggested you use a level 6/7/8 [weak/normal/elite Hunter](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=907) as appropriate to your group.

## Party Levelling Milestones

- Level 7: Party should be over half way to 8th level at start of the book 
- Level 8: After first encounter with the Grauls
- Level 9: Midway through Fort Rannick
- Level 10: Near end of Skull's Crossing
- Level 11: Party should be close to level 11 at the end of the book.

Target for this book is therefore 2800 level adjusted XP

## Section XP Rewards
  
Part | Title | Max XP 
-----|-------|----
0 | Turtleback Ferry     | 100
1 | In The Hook's Shadow | 880
2 | Retaking Rannick     | 970
3 | Down Comes the Rain  | 600
4 | The Haunted Heart    | 90
5 | Harrowing the Hook   | 490

- As per the original AP, the guide assumes fast advancement of 800 XP per level.

- Encounters use the 1E Challenge Rating (CR) as their basis. Creature levels are usually the same as CR or 1 or 2 higher. Relatively low CRs tend to need to be raised more to work in 2E.

## Target Allocation of Treasure

Level | Total gp | Permanent Items         | Consumables                        | Cash    | Part
------|----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|-----
  8   | 4,000gp  | **9th:** 2 **8th:** 2   | **9th:** 2 **8th:** 2 **7th:** 2   | 1,000gp | 1
  9   | 5,700gp  | **10th:** 2 **9th:** 2  | **10th:** 2 **9th:** 2 **8th:** 2	| 1,400gp | 2
  10  | 8,000gp  | **11th:** 2 **10th:** 2 | **11th:** 2 **10th:** 2 **9th:** 2 | 2,000gp | 3  

[Full Level to Wealth Chart](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=581)

[Treasure allocation approach](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a_elP7ClHzSNUCdade_noig8yZDG5dQXmBSDK98G1_A/edit?usp=sharing)

This adventure contains treasure for 8th, 9th, and 10th levels (it assumes that treasure for level 7 was acquired prior to the start of this adventure). 

The wealth to level chart was followed such that the treasure explicitly laid out in the "loot" sections adds up to exactly 17,700 GP in value (4000 gp + 5700 gp + 8000 gp). Permanent items and consumables matching the guidelines were provided (i.e. 2x 9th level and 2x 8th level for Level 8), and lower-level items were included as well for flavor. 

It's assumed that even though NPCs may use consumable items in their possession, those items will still become part of the loot. If you decide not to do this, you should replace it with something else (or just increase the cash value of currency items). 

Currency is lower than the guidelines, due to the cost of the permanent and consumable items. 

Spellbooks are valued at 50% of the cost of "learn a spell" for the highest-level spells only, usually those currently memorized by the NPC.

Sihedron Medallions are valued at 160 gp (equivalent to a 2nd level wand of False Life). 

GP value of currency items was scaled down to take into account the treasure guidelines and the fact that gold in 2E is worth considerably more than in 1E. However, the  value of non-magic item valuables (i.e. jewelry, maps, etc.) relative to each other as laid out in the original RotR AP is more or less maintained. For example, Lucrecia's silver necklace was originally worth 200 gp and her ring was worth 300 gp. They are now worth 25 and 40 gp (keeping the ratios approximately the same). 

Treasure was provided for a party of 4. If you have additional party members, include additional treasure and items per the "Full level to Wealth Chart" and accompanying information linked above.  

Note there is no contingency in the treasure. If your players miss something early on in the adventure, you may need to include additional items later.

### General Encounter Advice

Apply [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) or [Elite](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) templates as appropriate, or add/remove minions, to suit the capabilities and size of your party.  

If they are finding it hard going then liberally apply weak templates or remove minions.  

If they are breezing through then liberally apply elite templates or add minions. 

Usually, it is more interesting to have several low to moderate threat creatures in the encounter rather than a single severe one.

## Part 0: Turtleback ferry (XP 100, Party Level 7)

These investigations and encounters could happen at any point during the book.  

### Investigating the story of The Paradise and Lucrecia (10xp story award)

  - Award story XP for following up on the story of the Paradise to get further information on Lucrecia and the Paradise, and for noticing the sihedron tattoos on the villagers.

### Wreck of the Paradise (XP 80, Moderate Threat, +10xp story award, optional encounter)

  - **Creatures**
    - Use either a [Giant Snapping Turtle](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=837) or a giant gar [huge Megaladon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=366)
    - If the party are higher than level 7 when they investigate The Paradise, then apply the Elite template accordingly

  - **Encounter Notes:**   
    - The Paradise sank near the edge of the territory of a giant gar / snapping turtle (locally infamous "Old Pinkeye") and anyone in a craft 20ft long or smaller or anyone entering the water here will draw its hostile attention in a few minutes at most.
    - Killing Old Pinkeye will make the PCs local heroes and improve the attitude of everyone in Turtleback Ferry towards them for social interactions.
    - Their meat is a delicacy and there is enough in a huge creature to provide a much-needed boost to the local economy.
    - Turtle shell is a prized hull for local fishing boats as it has a reputation for preventing giant gar attacks.
    - Successfully investigating the wreck of the Paradise provides some clues and a story award of 10xp.

## Part 1: In The Hook's Shadow (XP 880, Party Level 7/8)

For ogrekin, custom creatures have been created, based on ogre templates.

For traps, near fit hazards have been used. Note the traps are unlikely to be a significant hazard on their own, but if they trigger other encounters or happen during an encounter, they are more serious.

Encounters include scaling for level 8 parties.

  - If you think any of your players may have foreknowledge consider switching who the traitor is

## Part 2: Retaking Rannick (XP 970, Party Level 8-9) 

Note these are mostly lower threat individual encounters, but there is a high likelihood of two or more combining in this setting. Usually the most threatening thing they can do is yell for assistance. Also note large creatures hit very hard so crits are especially dangerous. Be wary of increasing their level. If you have an inexperienced or gung-ho players, or a sub-optimal PC mix, then scale back the use of elite templates. To up the challenge level you just need to make it more likely encounters will combine.

If there are additional NPCs tagging along such as the rescued Black Arrows and/or Shelalu then you likely have more flexibility in managing threat levels, adding minions to balance and running low threat encounters together.

### Standard Ogre conversions (throughout rest of book 3):

To make ogres XP relevant to both level 8 and level 9 parties the following replacement standard ogres are used in PF2

PF1 Monster  | PF1 CR | PF2 Monster Base | PF2 Adjustment | PF2 Level | XP (party level 8/9)
-------------|--------|------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------------
Ogre         | 3      | [Ogre Warrior](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=317)     | +2 Levels   | 5 | 15/10
Ogre Fighter | 8      | [Ogre Boss](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=319)        | +1 Level | 8 | 40/30

These adjusted creatures are simply referred to as Kreeg Warrior and Kreeg Boss throughout the rest of this book.

    ![Lucrecia PNG](./Statblocks/Lucrecia.png)

  - **Encounter Notes:**
    - Be aware that Lucrecia has several **incapacitation** effects, and you need to use these carefully as these have full effect on lower-level PCs 
    - The lamias will use deception and disguise as they see fit (and they have had lots of practice and enjoy doing it). Create or choose a deception that will resonate with your players or you feel you can roleplay well. Some examples:
      - If Kaven is with the party they will weave him into the deception by using his name as they recognize him from The Paradise
      - Lucrecia might also thank the black arrows (or Jakardros personally if someone uses his name) for conveniently leading the patrol away from the fort on the day of the attack
      - If they are aware of the parties approach the Lamias could be in human form posing as black arrows using the humanoid form and illusory disguise spells.
        - They claim that any black arrows accompanying the party are either imposters or deserters (except Kaven) as best fits the circumstance.
        - They say they are holed up in here as they were driven back by the ogres and they are grateful to be rescued. 
      - They may all be playing a friendly gambling game and invite the PCs to join them. Lucrecia says she made a deal with the ogres that allows this secret black arrows gambling den to continue operating for a share of the profits.
      - They could create a model of The Paradise barge using the illusory object spell and claim it is the real thing shrunk and threaten to smash it and kill the occupants.

  - **Loot:**
    - [Candle of Truth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=240) [C8]

     - Make a note if any PCs name is spoken in earshot of Black Magga. She will remember this and use Dream Message later to taunt them.
     - XP is awarded for the bravery of engaging with Black Magga and defending the church / driving her off
     - This improves the attitude of everyone in Turtleback Ferry towards them for any social interaction checks

    - 4x Kreeg Warriors

    ![Grazuul PNG](./Statblocks/Grazuul.png)

  - **Encounter Notes:**   
    - Grazuul is underwater when visitors arrive and he uses aquatic ambush to launch his attack and then makes a bestial roar that sounds a lot like "Grazuul"
    - He is likely to have partial cover for most of this encounter.
    - Grazuul has terrain advantage which adds to the challenge level of this encounter (included in XP reward) 

  - **Loot:** +1 Returning Trident [P3]

### C15. Floodgate Controls (XP 60, low threat)

  - **Creatures:**
    - [Skull Ripper PDF](./Statblocks/SkullRipper.pdf)

    ![Skull Ripper](./Statblocks/SkullRipper.png)

### C16. Infernal Engines (XP 80-120 plus hero point)

  - Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion): DC 40 to identify the creature
  - award 80 XP for figuring out how to open the floodgates  (and saving tens of thousands of lives) regardless of their negotiations with Avaxial
  - If they do so without killing a creature (other than Avaxial; and summons or evil creatures don't count) award an additional 40XP
  - Infernal Engine: [Curse, Death]
    - The magical circle drains the life force of the creature within the circle to power the floodgate. Though the magic has waned over the millennia, it still requires a DC29 fortitude save or the creature within becomes drained 1 and sickened 1, or has its sickened and drained values increased by 1. The sickened value cannot be reduced below the drained value while afflicted with this curse. If the creature critically fails this save, the drained value gained from this failed save does not reduce by 1 with rest as it would normally, and must be magically restored. 
    - Avaxial is currently drained 16 and sickened 16, and has been for several decades, and will say and do almost anything to end his suffering.
