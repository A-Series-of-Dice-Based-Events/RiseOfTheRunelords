## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder Second Edition (2E)

### TO DO
  - Final review and clean up.

### Party Level and Target Allocation of Treasure

- Lvl 8: After first encounter with the Grauls
- Lvl 9: Midway through Fort Rannick
- Lvl 10: Near end of Skull's Crossing

Level | Total gp | Permanent Items         | Consumables                        | Cash    | Part
------|----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|-----
  8   | 4,000gp  | **9th:** 2 **8th:** 2   | **9th:** 2 **8th:** 2 **7th:** 2   | 1,000gp | 1
  9   | 5,700gp  | **10th:** 2 **9th:** 2  | **10th:** 2 **9th:** 2 **8th:** 2	| 1,400gp | 2

[Full Level to Wealth Chart](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=581)

Treasure allocation approach: 

This adventure contains treasure for 8th, 9th, and 10th levels (it assumes that treasure for level 7 was acquired prior to the start of this adventure). 

The wealth to level chart was followed such that the treasure explicitly laid out in the "loot" sections adds up to exactly 17,700 GP in value (4000 gp + 5700 gp + 8000 gp). Permanent items and consumables matching the guidelines were provided (i.e. 2x 9th level and 2x 8th level for Level 8), and lower level items were included as well for flavor. 

It's assumed that even though NPCs may use consumable items in their possession, those items will still become part of the loot. If you decide not to do this, you should replace it with something else (or just increase the cash value of currency items). 

Currency is lower than that the guidelines, due to the cost of the permanent and consumable items. 

Spellbooks were valued at 50% of the cost of "learn a spell" for the highest level spells currently memorized by the NPC. 

Sihedron Medallions are valued at 500 gp (equivalent to a 2nd level wand of False Life). 

GP value of currency items was scaled down to take into account the treasure guidelines and the fact that gold in 2E is higher than in 1E. However, the  value of non magic item valuables (i.e. jewelry, maps, etc) relative to each other as laid out in the original RotR AP is more or less maintained. For example, Lucrecia's silver necklace was originally worth 200 gp and her ring was worth 300 gp. They are now worth 25 and 40 gp (keeping the ratios approximately the same). 

Treasure was provided for a party of 4. If you have additional party members, include additional treasure and items per the "Full level to Wealth Chart" and accompanying information linked above.  

### General Encounter Advice

Apply (double) [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) or (double) [Elite](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) templates as appropriate, or add/remove minions, to suit the capabilities and size of your party.  
If they are finding it hard going then liberally apply weak templates.  
If they are breezing through then liberally apply elite templates.  


## Part 0: Turtleback ferry (XP 150, Party Level 7)

These investigations and encounters could happen at any point during the book.  

### Paradise and Lucrecia (30xp story award)

  - Award 30 story XP for following up on the story of the Paradise to get further information on Lucrecia and the Paradise, and for noticing the sihedron tattoos.

### Wreck of the Paradise (XP 80, Moderate Threat, +40xp story award)

  - **Creatures**
    - [Giant Snapping Turtle](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=837)
    - If the party are higher than level 7 when they investigate the paradise then apply the Elite or double Elite template accordingly

  - **Encounter Notes:**   
    - The paradise sank near the edge of the territory of a giant snapping turtle and anyone in a craft 20ft long or smaller or anyone entering the water will draw its hostile attention in a few minutes at most
    - Killing a giant snapping turtle will make the PCs local heroes and improve the attitude of everyone in Turtleback Ferry towards them for the purposes of any social interation checks
    - Turtle meat is a delicacy and there is enough in a gaint turtle to provide a much needed boost to the local economy
    - Turtle shell is a prized hull for local fishing boats
    - Succesfully investigating the wreck of the Paradise provides some clues and a story award of 40xp


## Part 1: In The Hook's Shadow (XP 870, Party Level 7/8)

For ogrekin, custom creatures have been created, based on ogre templates.

## Part 2: Retaking Rannick (XP 1050, Party Level 8-9) 

Note these are mostly lower threat individual encounters, but there is a high likelihood of two or more combining in this setting. Usually the most threatening thing they can do is yell for assistance. Also note large creatures hit very hard so crits are especially dangerous. Be wary of increasing their level. If you have an inexperienced or gung-ho players, or a sub-optimal PC mix, then scale back the use of elite templates. To up the challenge level you just need to make it more likely encounters will combine.

### Standard Ogre conversions (throughout rest of book 3):

To make ogres XP relevant to both level 8 and level 9 parties the following replacement standard ogres are used in PF2

PF1 Monster  | PF1 CR | PF2 Monster Base | PF2 Adjustment | PF2 Level | XP (party level 8/9)
