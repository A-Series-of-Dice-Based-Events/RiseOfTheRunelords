### General Notes and Advice

Apply (double) [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) or (double) [Elite](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) templates as appropriate to suit the capabilities of your party. 
If they are finding it hard going then liberally apply weak templates. 
If they are breezing through then liberally apply elite templates. 


## Part 0: Turtleback ferry (XP 150, Party Level 7)

These investigations and encounters could happen at any point during the book.  

### Paradise and Lucrecia (30xp story award)

  - For following up on the story of the Paradise to get further information on Lucrecia and what the Paradise was doing, and for noticing the sihedron tattoos.

### Wreck of the Paradise (XP 80, Moderate Threat, +40xp story award)

  - **Creatures**
    - [Giant Snapping Turtle](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=837)
    - If the party are higher than level 7 when they investigate the paradise then apply the Elite or double Elite template accordingly

  - **Encounter Notes:**   
    - The paradise sank near the edge of the territory of a giant snapping turtle and anyone in a craft 20ft long or smaller or anyone entering the water will draw its hostile attention in a few minutes at most
    - Killing a giant snapping turtle will make the PCs local heroes and improve the attitude of everyone in Turtleback Ferry towards them for the purposes of any social interation checks
    - Turtle meat is a delicacy and there is enough in a gaint turtle to provide a much needed boost to the local economy
    - Turtle shell is a prized hull for local boats
    - Succesfully investigating the wreck of the Paradise provides some clues and a story award of 40xp

## Part 2: Retaking Rannick (XP 1060/750, Party Level 8-9)

Note these are mostly lower threat individual encounters, but there is a high likelihood of two or more combining in this setting. Usually the most threatening thing they can do is yell for assistance. Also note large creatures hit very hard so crits are especially dangerous. Be wary of increasing their level. If you have an inexperienced or gung-ho players, or a sub-optimal PC mix, then scale back the use of elite templates. To up the challenge level you just need to make it more likely encounters will combine.

To make ogres XP relevant to both level 8 and level 9 parties the following replacement standard ogres are used in PF2

PF1 Monster  | PF1 CR | PF2 Monster Base | PF2 Adjustment | PF2 Level | XP (party level 8/9)
