## Part 1: In The Hook's Shadow

As the players run through Part1, allow an NPC to come to their aid with healing if any of the PCs get too beat up. Part1 shouldn't be brutal but rather fun and exciting. Feel free to withold the NPC if the players are more experienced. Most creatures I've added the [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) template too, to help make this not so dire. -Mirko
