# RotR Fortress of the Stone Giants (levels 10-13)

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder Second Edition (2E)

- This conversion guide covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and monsters, hazards, DCs, XP, level based treasure, and occassionally tactics.
- The plot, back story, color text, maps, floor plans, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
- Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/)].
- New creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in a consolidated sub directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In many instances there are several variants available. Note their unique numerical suffixes assigned by monster builder are removed to save updating this document every time the creature is tweaked.
- If you find an issue, error or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then create a pull request. This is a community project and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## General GM information

  - A lot of encounters in this book use mostly standard creatures, sometimes with an elite template, which are easy enough to generate without guidance. Where that is the case, then location and encounter notes will concentrate on the none-creature aspects.
  - DCs are not converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. This is left up to GM discretion.
  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
 
## Index and XP distribution
  
Part | Title | Max XP 
-----|-------|----
0 | A | 1

- XP is allocated, and encounters adjusted, to match the original AP levelling guidelines at fast advancement. 
- Encounters use the 1E Challenge Rating (CR) as their basis. Creature levels are usually the same as CR or 1 or 2 higher. Relatively low CRs tend to need to be raised more to work in 2E.

## General Encounter Advice

- Apply (double) [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) or (double) [Elite](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) templates as appropriate, or add/remove minions, to suit the capabilities and size of your party.  
- If they are finding it hard going then liberally apply weak templates or remove minions.  
- If they are breezing through then liberally apply elite templates or add minions. 
- Usually it is more interesting to have several low to moderate threat creatures in the encounter rather than a single severe one.

## Raid on Sandpoint (xp 385, multiple low to moderate encounters)

  - **Creatures:** 
    - [Stone Giants](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=221)
    - [Elite](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) [Cave Bears](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=48)
    - [Elite](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) [Young red dragon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=136)
    - [Teraktinus] TO DO
  - **Notes:**
    - The six encounters are spread out with ratings from low to moderate only.
    - The giants tactics make the encounters slightly easier (e.g. the rest run away when one in that group dies).
    - It is unlikely in 2E that they can defeat the majority of encounters without rest between them.
    - 2E scaling means that the guard and the militia are totally ineffective against level+6/7 creatures.
    - The PCs will have to pick their fights very carefully.
    - The most notable and effective thing they could do with preparation is set traps.
    - Each giant that isn't blocked likely gets away with 3 prisoners.
    - If you dont want the Storval Stairs encounter completely bypassed (which is a common occurence noted by GMs), then it is useful to have captives mention the Storval Stairs, perhaps as a fallback location, or that they already mark the edge of the territory of the Giants, or that Mokmurian put great emphasis on defending the statues there, or somesuch. Also Brodert might mention the huge ancient statues and that he would like to see them someday.  

## Ogre Cattle Rustlers
 - **Creatures:** 
   - Ogre fighters as per Fort Rannick

## Storval Stairs
  - Note that this encounter seems to be the one most often completely bypassed. e.g. by flying or Teleport. Be prepared to move this encounter somewhere else. Or highlight this location in some other way, as above. Others have moved this to encounter to Skulls Crossing in Book3 if they have cleared out the ogres and returned later.
