Each non-harpy creature within a 300-foot aura must attempt a DC 25 Will save to avoid becoming captivated by the harpy's song. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the harpy uses this ability again on subsequent rounds, it extends the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Captivating Song, that creature is temporarily immune to Captivating Songs for 24 hours.","src":"Harpy","id":"_73pbk7ploo"},{"id":"_71ltg11vyh","name":"Deflect Arrow","traits":"Monk","range":"","actions":"reaction","type":"defense","description":"Requirements Youâ€™re aware of the attack, are not flat-footed against it, and have a hand free.\nTrigger You are the target of a physical ranged attack. \nYou gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
