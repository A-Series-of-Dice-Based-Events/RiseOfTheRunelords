# RotR Sins of the Saviors (levels 13-15)

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder Second Edition (2E)

- This conversion guide covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and monsters, hazards, DCs, XP, level based treasure, and some tactics.
- The plot, back story, color text, maps, floor plans, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
- Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/)].
- New creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in a consolidated sub directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In some instances there are several variants available. Note their unique numerical suffixes assigned by monster builder are usually removed to save updating this document every time the creature is tweaked.
- If you find an issue, error, or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then create a pull request. This is a community project, and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## General GM information

  - Many encounters in this book use standard creatures, sometimes with an elite template, which are easy to generate without guidance. 
  - DCs are not converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard statblock, or are particularly significant. This is left up to GM discretion.
  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify, or leave as you see fit.
 
## Party levelling milestones

- Level 13: The PCs should be 13th level when they begin this chapter.
- Level 14: The PCs should reach 14th level after defeating the white dragon Arkrhyst.
- Level 15:  The PCs should reach 15th level by the time they begin exploring the sixth wing of Runeforge (since the exact order in which they explore the wings of this dungeon is fluid, they may hit 15th level earlier if they manage to explore and survive the more dangerous wings of Runeforge earlier than expected).
- Level 15+: The PCs should be well into 15th level by the time they finish this chapter.

- XP is allocated, and encounters adjusted, to match the original AP levelling guidelines at fast advancement. 
- Encounters use the 1E Challenge Rating (CR) as their basis. Bosses and single creatures are usually the same as CR or 1 or 2 higher. Minions with low CRs tend to be raised more to work in 2E.

## General Encounter Advice

- Apply [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) or [Elite](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) templates as appropriate, or add/remove minions, to suit the capabilities and size of your party.  
- If they are finding it hard going then liberally apply weak templates or remove minions.  
- If they are breezing through, then liberally apply elite templates or add minions. 
- Usually, it is more interesting to have several low to moderate threat creatures in the encounter rather than a single severe one.

  - The Scribbler's suggestion, by @Nintendogeek01:
  - ![The Scribbler's Suggestion](./Statblocks/ScribblerSuggestion.png)
  - Revelation Quill, by @Nintendogeek01:
  **Revelation Quill**: Item 20 [Rare, Artifact, Divination, Magical]
  **Usage** held in 1 hand; Bulk L
  This quill is fashioned from a peacock's tail feather. Its nib is made of bone, and when held in one's hand, the quill seems strangely heavy. If placed in an empty vial or other glass container of similar size and left there for one hour, a revelation quill fills that container with ink. The ink created is of a random color 50% of the time, otherwise the ink is black. A Revelation Quill can act as a standard writing implement, its true strength lies in its ability to answer questions.
  **Activate** 10 minutes (Envision); **Frequency** Once per day; While holding the quill, the user concentrates on a specific future goal, event, or activity occurring within the coming week, the Revelation Quill takes over and writes out a response similar to the way Augury functions except the response can be a short phrase, often in the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.
  **Activate** 10 minutes (Envision); **Frequency** Once per week; Upon activation, the user may use the quill in the same way to ask the mysterious intellect that guides the Revelation Quill up to 10 questions as though the user has rolled a success to cast the Commune Ritual.
  **Destruction**: The quill must be tricked into revealing the method of destroying itself without asking it to reveal that method.

- [Dominant Weapon](./Statblocks/DominantWeapon.pdf)
- ![Dominant Weapon PNG](./Statblocks/DominantWeapon.png)
- Designers notes: Discussion of dominant/commanding weapons reasoned that outright countering was not in keeping with other 2E abilities, and that a counteract ability was closest to intent. The current definition borrows from aligned weapons and for the reaction ability from the ring of counterspells and the ring of spell turning. Note that spell DCs of Khalib and Karzoug in book 6 are in the mid 40s so a counteract of 30 is only around a 25% chance of working vs them, though with all PCs having a dominant weapon the odds of one of them working is high. To raise the counteract modifier would require raising the level of the item. Another option considered (of the same level) was an effect based on the foresight spell, effectively allowing 2 saving throws, keep the highest, or 2 targeting rolls, take the lowest.
