## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder Second Edition (2E)

- This conversion guide covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and monsters, hazards, DCs, XP, level based treasure, and occassionally tactics.
- The plot, back story, color text, maps, floor plans, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
- Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/)].
- New creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in a consolidated sub directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In many instances there are several variants available. Note their unique numerical suffixes assigned by monster builder are removed to save updating this document every time the creature is tweaked.
- If you find an issue, error or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then create a pull request. This is a community project and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## General GM information

  - Many encounters in this book use standard creatures, sometimes with an elite template, which are easy enough to generate without guidance. Where that is the case, then location and encounter notes will concentrate on the none-creature aspects.
  - There are encounters where multiple much lower level creatures are used in 1E. To ensure these stay relevant in 2E, these should be dynamically adjusted so they are no lower than the 4 levels below the party level. Apply elite templates as required. 
  - DCs are not converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. This is left up to GM discretion.
  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
 
## Party levelling milestones

- Level 13: The PCs should be 13th level when they begin this chapter.
- Level 14: The PCs should reach 14th level after defeating the white dragon Arkrhyst.
- Level 15:  The PCs should reach 15th level by the time they begin exploring the sixth wing of Runeforge (since the exact order in which they explore the wings of this
dungeon is fluid, they may hit 15th level earlier if they manage to explore and survive the more dangerous wings of Runeforge earlier than expected).
- Level 15+: The PCs should be well into 15th level by the time they finish this chapter.
 
## Index and XP distribution
  
Title | Max XP 
------|-------
XXX | 500

- XP is allocated, and encounters adjusted, to match the original AP levelling guidelines at fast advancement. 
- Encounters use the 1E Challenge Rating (CR) as their basis. Creature levels are usually the same as CR or 1 or 2 higher. Relatively low CRs tend to need to be raised more to work in 2E.

## TO DO - EVERYTHING
  - all unique creatures
  - xp & threat rating
  - treasure by level

## General Encounter Advice

- Apply (double) [Weak](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791) or (double) [Elite](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790) templates as appropriate, or add/remove minions, to suit the capabilities and size of your party.  
- If they are finding it hard going then liberally apply weak templates or remove minions.  
- If they are breezing through then liberally apply elite templates or add minions. 
- Usually it is more interesting to have several low to moderate threat creatures in the encounter rather than a single severe one.
