A Runeforged rune counts as a property rune but is not restricted by the property rune limit, although a weapon can never have more than one Runeforged rune. Anyone wielding a Runeforged weapon takes a â€“2 penalty on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the expense of personality. A creature that carries two Runeforged weapons, even those of the same type, is Sickened 5 as her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges, and can only lose this condition by removing one of the weapons.\nA Commanding weapon with this intertwined illusion and enchantment Runeforged rune deals an extra 2d6 mental damage against transmuters and shapechangers, e.g. creatures with the change shape ability. If you are a shapechanger or a transmuter specialist wizard you are enfeebled 2 while carrying or wielding this weapon.\n\n(R): Envision; **Trigger:** you are targeted by a transmutation spell or you make a successful Strike against a creature under the effect of a transmutation spell.\n \n**Effect:** Make a counteract +30 check to counter the spell.\n**Daily Limit:** This ability can counter no more than 9 total levels of spells per day. If you activate this ability to counter a spell that would exceed this limit, the attempt fails, but the attempted usage does not count toward the daily limit.
