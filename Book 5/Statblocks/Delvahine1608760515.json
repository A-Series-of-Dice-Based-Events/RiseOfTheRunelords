When a succubus fails a Diplomacy check to Embrace or Request, or when a creature succeeds at its save against a succubus's mental spell or ability, the succubus takes 2d6 mental damage. For one hour after causing mental damage to a succubus in this way, a creature can deal 2d6 mental damage to the succubus with a successful Demoralize incorporating its rejection.","src":"Succubus","id":"_2cki26w4exa"},{"name":"Seductive Presence","actions":"none","traits":"aura, charm, emotion, mental","type":"defense","description":"10 feet.

The kiss makes the creature drained 1 or increases its drained condition by 1, to a maximum of 4. The creature takes 3d6 negative damage and the succubus regains Hit Points equal to the damage dealt.

As long as the gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, see through the creature's senses, and target the creature with suggestion through the telepathic link. In addition, the creature uses an outcome one degree of success worse than it rolls on saving throws against the lust demon's suggestions.\nA humanoid can't have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can't grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an atone ritual. The succubus can remove the gift as a free action to give the recipient a permanent stupefied 3 condition. A 4th-level restoration spell is required to reduce this stupefied condition by 1. A summoned succubus can't grant a profane gift.","src":"Succubus","id":"_219oeu2869b"}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"ce","size":"medium","type":"fiend","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":28,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":36,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"creature","speed":"25 feet, fly 35 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"Occult innate","focuspoints":"","cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","force cage, warp mind","dominate, vampiric exsanguination, zealous conviction","dimension door, subconscious suggestion, synaptic pulse","dimension door (at will), suggestion (at will), aromatic lure","mind reading (at will), enthrall, heroism","detect alignment (at will), blistering invective, charitable urge","agitate, bane, charm","guidance, dancing lights, prestidigitation, summon instrument, join pasts"],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":9,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"perception":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":30,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":33,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":30,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":25,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"society":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":36,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":271,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":23,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"will":{"value":29,"benchmark":"high","note":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"cold iron 15, good 15","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"electricity, fire, poison","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"type":"Melee","name":"claw","attack":28,"traits":"agile, evil, finesse, magical","damage":"3d10+14 slashing plus 1d6 evil","id":"_1wybkrq4qag"}],"src":"Monsters98","time":1596276713,"languages":"Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic; three additional mortal languages; telepathy 100 feet, tongues","tags":[]}
