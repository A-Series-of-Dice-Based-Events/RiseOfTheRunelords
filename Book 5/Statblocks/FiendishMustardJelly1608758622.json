One ooze is in the same space as the original, and the other is in an adjacent, unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or heavy to push).","src":"Carnivorous Blob","id":"_201xvnj6kkq"},{"name":"Energy Absorption","actions":"none","traits":"","type":"defense","description":"The Mustard Jelly is immune to electricity and magic missiles.
