Jordimandus cannot cast any spells from the Evocation or Illusion schools."},{"id":"_1x7d12f7lxx","name":"Heart of Slime","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"general","description":"Jordimandus' heart grants him supernatural constitution and fortitude. When he rolls a success on a fortitude save, he gets a critical success instead. He is immune to critical hits and precision damage. The heart also makes him effectively immortal by ceasing his aging and nourishing him. Oozes do not attack Jordimandus as a result of his unholy heart. If all four of the variant ochre jellies in the surrounding pipes are slain, Jordimandusâ€™s access to the life-giving humors ceases and his heart begins to decay. He immediately loses all the benefits granted him by the heart, and furthermore becomes drained 1 and increases the drained value by 1 for each day until he perishes."}],"morespells":[{"id":"_4zrb9f1k6xo","name":"Arcane Focus","note":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":33,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spells":["","","","dimensional steps, augment summoning","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","focuspoints":2,"cantriplevel":""}],"alignment":"n","size":"medium","type":"humanoid","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"rod of negation, bag of holding (type III)","spellattack":{"value":25,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":33,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"10 feet, fly 20 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"Arcane Prepared","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","Maze, Summon Entity","Duplicate Foe, Power Word Blind, Summon Entity","Purple Wom Sting, Repulsion, Slow","Blister, Black Tentacles, Impaling Spike","Dimension Door, Enervation, Fly","Aqueous Orb, Magical Fetters, Haste","False Life, See Invisibility, Hideous Laughter","Unseen Servant, Grease, Ray of Enfeeblement","acid splash, tanglefoot, detect magic, mage hand, prestidigitation"],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":2,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"constitution":{"value":8,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":8,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"acrobatics":{"value":25,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"arcana":{"value":30,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"athletics":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":30,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":36,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":279,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":29,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":23,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"will":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_2nxvjg5dbew","name":"Dagger","traits":"","attack":24,"damage":"1d4+14 piercing damage","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Abyssal, Aklo, Draconic, Elven, Necril, Thassilonian","tags":[]}
