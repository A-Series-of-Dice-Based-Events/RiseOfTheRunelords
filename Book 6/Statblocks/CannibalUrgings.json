Without much more warning, those twinges erupt into full-blown pangs of painful starvation and unholy urges to feast on their companions. While these hunger pangs pass quickly, the damage to the mind is more  persistent.\nDisable DC 26 Survival (trained) to quickly retrieve and eat something before the hunger pangs escalate or DC 33 Religion (trained) to calm the spirits. Anyone actually eating when the haunt triggers is immune.\nPlenty of meat on those bones (Necromancy, Occult) \nTrigger 2 creatures, who aren't eating, stay in this room for more than a round.\nEffect When the hunger pangs strike, all characters in the room must make DC 34 Fortitude saves to resist being affected as though by a 6th level Feast of Ashes spell, and taking a days starvation damage immediately (5d4) and becoming fatigued from the sudden phantom hunger. Accompanying this ravenous sensation is the conviction that only the flesh of the other PCs can sate the hunger. Any character who took starvation damage must then make a DC 34 Will save to resist becoming clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, and stupefied 1 as the cannibal urgings overwhelm the PC and drive them to the brink of madness. The hunger and conditions persist only until they eat something.\nReset 1 day","plain":0,"meta":{"public":0,"url":"0RJOlsoO"}}
