His eyes are wild with fear, his clothes in tatters, and blood drips from several cuts on his exposed flesh. When he sees the PCs, he cries out, “Run! Run for your lives! They’re going to eat you!” With that, the dwarf flees into the snow. All PCs in the area  are affected by a Fear spell with a DC 30 Will save. Anyone critically failing the save and who race blindly into the snow in this manner have a flat 50% chance of running off the edge of the cliff, in which case they fall 60 feet to the ground below.\nReset 1 day","plain":0,"meta":{"public":0,"url":"6DT1Z7vM"}}
