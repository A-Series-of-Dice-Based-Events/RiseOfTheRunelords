With this discovery comes the conviction that the gnawed bones are, in fact, that character’s own. An instant later, that character becomes surrounded by a whirling storm of shadowy forms as the ghosts of the cannibalized dead attempt to add that PC to their number.\nDisable DC 38 Religion (trained) to temporarily sanctify the bones\nYou are already dead (Necromancy, Occult) \nTrigger A creature touches the bones\nEffect To observers, the haunted character suddenly begins thrashing wildly, as if dozens of invisible hands were tugging and pushing him about the room. At the same time, bloody wounds from invisible teeth appear across the victim’s body. The haunted character perceives that he has suddenly been surrounded by half a dozen emaciated but fantastically strong dwarves, all of whom are attempting to eat him alive. The 6 ghosts each make an attack roll against the PC at a +32 bonus; each hit deals 1d10+6 points of damage. A character killed by these bites is torn apart so that nothing remains but a red, well-gnawed skeleton draped in his gear.\nReset 1 minute","plain":0,"meta":{"public":0,"url":"TophSjV8"}}
