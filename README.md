# Rise Of The Runelords

changes I have made
[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert RotR to Pathfinder 2E.
The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

## Recommended Tool
http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.
