# Rise Of The Runelords

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert RotR to Pathfinder 2E.
The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

## How does this even work?

[What is Github?](https://youtu.be/U1C0F-Au9h4)
On GitHub, you can share text files (usually code) and collaborate with others. The nice thing is that README.md files display as you're browsing the folders of a GitHub Project using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). There's also and in browser editor that makes it easy to change the files you see and submit a request to chave them permanently changed. Just click into the file you want to change and select the edit button in the top right. <br/After changing, there will be a button at the bottom of the browser editor to "Propose file change", feel free to include a message on why it was changed.  After clicking that button, it will show you the changes you've made and have a new button near the top of the page to "Create pull request". This sends the changes in to become permanent record in the repository.

## Recommended Tool
http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.
