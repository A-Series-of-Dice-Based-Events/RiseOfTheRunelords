# Thassilonian Magic

This folder contains ancient items that are used in more than one book such as Sihedron Medallions, and several different takes on Sin Magic.

## Sihedron Medallions
[Sihedron Medallion PDF](SihedronMedallion.pdf)

[Greater Sihedron Medallion PDF](GreaterSihedronMedallion.pdf)

## One take on Sin Magic, by ZomBagus (?)
[Sin Magic Arcane Thesis PDF](ArcaneThesisSinMagic.pdf) and [Drain Sinful Item PDF](DrainSinfulItem.pdf)

Gives a new Arcane Thesis.

## Similar take on Sin Magic, by @Nintendogeek01
[Thassilonian Specialist PDF](ThassilonianSpecialistNintendogeek01.pdf)

Also gives a new Arcane Thesis.

## Different take on Sin Magic, by @Lawrencelot
[Thassilonian Specialist PDF (old version)](ThassilonianSpecialist.pdf) and [Thassilonian Specialist PDF (new version)](Thassilonian_Specialist_v2.pdf)

Gives a new Archetype instead of an Arcane Thesis. Has been playtested once (with the Wizard class, not with other spellcasting classes yet) up until level 11 and gone through some feedback, feels quite balanced so far.
