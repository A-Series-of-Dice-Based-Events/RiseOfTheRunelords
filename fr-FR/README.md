## Join us

To join us just ask @mirkorainer on GitHub or in the [A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)  

Once you're added as a member then you can add and approve changes. All the changes are tracked so if we make a mistake, we can refer back to the old version.  

## Recommended Tool

We generaly use the [PF2 Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) to create NPCs and Monsters. This uses JSON, PNG and PDF files, that can be easily imported/exported. 

This repository holds those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files.  

## No Copyright Materials

Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts, or any images or maps from the AP. Only submit modifications necessary to convert to 2E, such as the DCs and 2E builds of NPCs/Monsters/Hazards/Items plus XP and 2E level based treasure. Please include a location number or name for each encounter or item so GMs can cross-reference with the original scenario.

# Using Github

## How does this even work? 

[What is Github?](https://youtu.be/U1C0F-Au9h4)  
On GitHub, you can share text files (and code) and collaborate with others. The nice thing is that README.md files display as you're browsing the folders of a GitHub Project using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  

### Making Changes

There's an in browser editor that makes it easy to change the files you see and submit a request to chave them permanently changed. There is also a Github Desktop app that allows you to work using standard desktop tools.

Just click into the file you want to change and select the edit button in the top right.

After changing, there will be a button at the bottom of the browser editor to "Propose file change", feel free to include a message on why it was changed.
